# test-ssg

description

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## The link component

This provides an adapter for the use of [Next.js's Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) with MUI.
More information [in the documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/routing/#next-js).
